# SIRA — Job Portal Platform

SIRA is a full-stack job portal application where users can register, create/update profiles, apply for jobs, and administrators can manage jobs, users, and applications. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, MySQL (for users), MongoDB (for jobs & applications), and Cloudinary (for image and resume uploads).

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Node.js + Express
* MySQL (for authentication and user data)
* MongoDB + Mongoose (for job listings and applications)
* Cloudinary (for image and resume uploads)
* JWT (for secure login authentication)
* bcrypt (for password hashing)
* dotenv (for environment configs)

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sira-job-portal.git
   cd sira-job-portal/server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a config.env file inside the /config directory and add:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
   DB_NAME=job_portal
   CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Set up your MySQL database and import the schema for the users table. MongoDB collections for jobs and applications will be created automatically by Mongoose.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The server will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or your configured port).
